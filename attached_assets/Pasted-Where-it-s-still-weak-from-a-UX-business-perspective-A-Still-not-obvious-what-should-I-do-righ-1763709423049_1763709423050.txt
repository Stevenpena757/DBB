Where it’s still weak (from a UX & business perspective)
A. Still not obvious “what should I do right now?”

Even though the flows exist in the codebase (Consumer Journey and Business Journey in the README), they’re not obvious when you hit the homepage. 
GitHub

You still need more:

“I’m here to…” choice above the fold:

“Discover beauty services in DFW”

“Promote my beauty business”

Right now, it feels like a pretty, content-heavy site that talks about itself more than it directs people.

B. Businesses don’t immediately see the money story

You do have a solid business model—subscriptions, sponsored content, data insights. 
GitHub

But a salon owner landing on the site doesn’t instantly see:

“Claim this listing and get: visibility, leads, featured placements, future insights.”

That needs to be extremely direct on:

Business profile pages (“Are you the owner? Claim this page to unlock exposure & tools.”)

For Professionals page (short, benefit-led bullets, not too much narrative).

C. Content → Rewards isn’t tangible yet

Your README describes content rewards and “submit content to unlock featured placement and benefits”. 
GitHub

On the site, this still feels abstract. It should feel like:

“Post here → more exposure + perks.”

“Share tips, before/after stories, routines → eligible for features and shout-outs.”

Otherwise, you’ll struggle to get user-generated content, which you need for SEO and engagement.

D. Lead capture & data value aren’t surfaced

You plan to monetize insights and leads (data layer is part of the roadmap). 
GitHub

But right now:

There isn’t a simple email capture tied to clear value:

“Get curated DFW beauty picks and local offers in your inbox.”

Businesses don’t yet see:

“We turn anonymized user preferences into trend/intent insights you can use.”

You don’t need the full analytics product now, but you should start collecting emails and basic preference signals in a way that’s clearly explained.

3. What I’d do before pushing hard on growth

If this were my product, I’d do a small “tighten and clarify” pass rather than another big redesign. Focus on:

1) Add a simple 2-path strip near the hero

“I’m here to: [Discover beauty services] [Promote my beauty business]”

Each button takes them into:

/my-beauty-book (or Explore)

/for-professionals

This single element will do more for comprehension than another paragraph.

2) Make “Create Your Dallas Beauty Book” the star experience

Right now it’s cool, but it’s not clearly the main thing users should start with.

Put it in the hero or directly below.

Add a one-liner:

“Answer a few quick questions and we’ll build your personal DFW beauty guide.”

Tie this to sign-up and email capture in a gentle way.

3) Business pages: stronger “Claim this business” CTA

On each business listing page:

Add a banner or box:

“Are you the owner or manager? Claim this business to update your details, share content, and unlock visibility + future insights.”

Make the “Claim” button visually strong (but not obnoxious).

4) For Professionals page: tighten copy and add 3 bullets of value

Short, direct hero:

“Get your DFW beauty business in front of the right clients. Claim your listing, share your expertise, and grow with data-backed insights as we scale.”

Then:

Visibility (show up where DFW clients search)

Featured placements & promotions

Future anonymized insights (trends in services, neighborhoods, etc.)

Business owners should feel:

“Okay, this is built for me, and there’s a roadmap beyond a basic listing.”

5) Add one lightweight email / lead capture path

For example:

At the bottom of homepage:

“Stay in the loop as DallasBeautyBook grows—local beauty drops, new pros, and exclusive DFW offers.”

Simple field: email only.

This supports your future data/insights monetization and gives you a contact base before you ship the analytics layer.
