DALLASBEAUTYBOOK — TLDR REPLIT AGENT IMPLEMENTATION INSTRUCTIONS (V3 – GUIDED FLOWS)
======================================================================================
GOAL
----
Optimize DallasBeautyBook to clearly guide:
- USERS (locals) → to “Create Your Beauty Book” and “Explore Businesses”
- BUSINESSES (pros) → to “Claim Your Business” and “For Professionals”

Emphasize monetization levers in the UX:
- Businesses claiming their listings
- Users & businesses submitting content
- Data/insights as a future value-add

IMPORTANT: Keep all existing design, visual style, and functionality.
Only change copy, layout of sections on the homepage, and add small, simple blocks.


SECTION 0 — SAFETY RULES (DO NOT BREAK)
---------------------------------------
1. Do NOT:
   - Remove or rename existing pages, components, routes, or backend endpoints.
   - Modify database schemas or authentication logic.
   - Change Tailwind config, design tokens, or global styles (global.css / index.css).
   - Move/rename React component files or imports.

2. You MAY:
   - Replace text inside existing components.
   - Add new sections using existing layout patterns.
   - Reorder sections on the homepage.
   - Limit number of cards rendered in a section.
   - Add small text blocks or CTA rows.

3. Maintain existing mobile-first behavior & breakpoints.


SECTION A — HOMEPAGE: CLEAR 2-PERSONA “START HERE”
--------------------------------------------------
File: client/src/pages/Home.tsx (or equivalent homepage component)

A1. ADD “I’M HERE FOR…” CTA STRIP UNDER HERO
--------------------------------------------
Directly UNDER the hero section, add a slim strip with two big pill buttons:

<section className="mt-6 md:mt-8">
  <div className="max-w-5xl mx-auto px-4 flex flex-col md:flex-row gap-3 md:gap-4 md:items-center">
    <p className="text-sm font-medium text-[var(--dbb-charcoalSoft)]">
      I’m here to:
    </p>
    <div className="flex flex-wrap gap-2">
      <a
        href="/my-beauty-book"
        className="inline-flex items-center rounded-full px-4 py-2 text-sm font-semibold bg-[var(--dbb-roseSoft)] text-[var(--dbb-charcoal)] hover:opacity-90 transition"
      >
        Discover beauty services
      </a>
      <a
        href="/for-professionals"
        className="inline-flex items-center rounded-full px-4 py-2 text-sm font-semibold bg-[var(--dbb-surface)] border border-[var(--dbb-sand)] text-[var(--dbb-charcoalSoft)] hover:bg-[var(--dbb-sandSoft)] transition"
      >
        Promote my beauty business
      </a>
    </div>
  </div>
</section>

A2. HERO TEXT — KEEP SHORT & CLEAR
----------------------------------
Heading (keep current style, just ensure language is short):

“Where DFW Beauty Meets Community”

Paragraph (only 1 sentence):

“Discover local beauty pros, create your Dallas Beauty Book, and unlock personalized offers and insights across Dallas–Fort Worth.”

A3. ADD “START HERE” SPLIT SECTION (FOR LOCALS VS PROS)
--------------------------------------------------------
Place this BELOW the “How it works” section and ABOVE the Beauty Book highlight or Explore.

<section className="mt-16 md:mt-24">
  <div className="max-w-5xl mx-auto px-4 grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 gap-6">
    {/* For locals */}
    <div className="rounded-2xl border border-[var(--dbb-sand)] bg-[var(--dbb-surface)] px-5 py-6">
      <p className="text-xs uppercase tracking-[0.25em] text-[var(--dbb-rose)] mb-2">
        For locals
      </p>
      <h2 className="font-heading text-xl md:text-2xl mb-3">
        Start your Dallas beauty journey
      </h2>
      <ol className="text-sm text-[var(--dbb-charcoalSoft)] space-y-2 mb-4">
        <li>1. Create your Dallas Beauty Book for personalized ideas.</li>
        <li>2. Explore businesses by category and city.</li>
        <li>3. Save favorites and join the community conversations.</li>
      </ol>
      <a
        href="/my-beauty-book"
        className="inline-flex items-center rounded-full px-4 py-2 text-sm font-semibold bg-[var(--dbb-roseSoft)] text-[var(--dbb-charcoal)] hover:opacity-90 transition"
      >
        Create Your Beauty Book →
      </a>
    </div>

    {/* For pros */}
    <div className="rounded-2xl border border-[var(--dbb-sand)] bg-[var(--dbb-surface)] px-5 py-6">
      <p className="text-xs uppercase tracking-[0.25em] text-[var(--dbb-rose)] mb-2">
        For beauty professionals
      </p>
      <h2 className="font-heading text-xl md:text-2xl mb-3">
        Get in front of DFW beauty seekers
      </h2>
      <ol className="text-sm text-[var(--dbb-charcoalSoft)] space-y-2 mb-4">
        <li>1. Find or submit your business listing.</li>
        <li>2. Claim your page and update your services.</li>
        <li>3. Share content to unlock featured placement and promotions.</li>
      </ol>
      <a
        href="/for-professionals"
        className="inline-flex items-center rounded-full px-4 py-2 text-sm font-semibold bg-[var(--dbb-surface)] border border-[var(--dbb-sand)] text-[var(--dbb-charcoal)] hover:bg-[var(--dbb-sandSoft)] transition"
      >
        For Professionals →
      </a>
    </div>
  </div>
</section>

A4. KEEP “HOW IT WORKS” BUT MAKE EACH STEP 1 LINE
-------------------------------------------------
Ensure each step in the “How it works” section is ONE LINE only (no long paragraphs):

1. “Answer a few questions to create your Beauty Book.”  
2. “We match you with DFW beauty pros and categories.”  
3. “Explore, save, and join the community.”

No extra text.


SECTION B — WELCOME MODAL: USE IT AS A CHOICE GATE
--------------------------------------------------
File: client/src/components/WelcomeModal.tsx (or equivalent)

B1. SHORTEN TITLE & BODY
------------------------
Title:
“Welcome to DallasBeautyBook”

Paragraph:
“A DFW hub for beauty, wellness, and aesthetics. Choose how you’d like to start.”

B2. TWO MAIN CHOICES
--------------------
Inside the modal, present:

- Button 1: “I’m looking for beauty services”  
  - Action: close modal, navigate to /my-beauty-book

- Button 2: “I run or manage a beauty business”  
  - Action: close modal, navigate to /for-professionals

Small tertiary link:
- “Just browse for now” → close modal, stay on homepage.

Keep existing logic for when the modal appears; only update UI and text.


SECTION C — FOR PROFESSIONALS PAGE: CLEAR BUSINESS VALUE
--------------------------------------------------------
File: client/src/pages/ForProfessionalsPage.tsx

C1. HERO PARAGRAPH
------------------
Use a single clear paragraph:

“DallasBeautyBook connects your beauty business with local clients across DFW. Claim your listing, share your expertise, and unlock visibility, leads, and future insights.”

C2. SHORT 3-STEP FLOW
---------------------
Ensure the steps read:

1. **Claim your business** – Verify your listing or submit a new one.  
2. **Get discovered in Beauty Books** – Be recommended when locals share their goals and location.  
3. **Share content & unlock promotions** – Post tips and updates to earn more visibility and rewards.

C3. BENEFITS LIST
-----------------
Present benefits as short bullets:

- **More Visibility in DFW** – Show up where beauty seekers are browsing.  
- **Better Matching** – Appear in personalized Beauty Books.  
- **Featured Listings & Campaigns** – Eligible for spotlights and paid promotions.  
- **Future Data & Insights** – Anonymized trends about what locals are exploring.

C4. CLAIM + INCENTIVE LINE
--------------------------
Under the main Claim CTA, add a line:

“Businesses that claim and contribute content receive increased visibility, priority placement, and access to future promotional discounts.”


SECTION D — CONTENT & REWARDS: MAKE INCENTIVE EXPLICIT
------------------------------------------------------
D1. HOMEPAGE COMMUNITY PREVIEW
------------------------------
Under the Community/Forum preview on Home, add a one-line message:

“Every post, tip, and story helps the community—and can unlock rewards like features, shout-outs, and special offers.”

D2. SUBMIT/CREATE CONTENT PAGE
------------------------------
At the top of any “create post” or “submit content” page, ensure intro is:

“Share your expertise and experience with the DFW beauty community. Contributors are eligible for spotlights, featured placements, and future rewards.”

No backend changes required; this is forward-looking messaging.


SECTION E — DATA & INSIGHTS (SHORT + FUTURE-FOCUSED)
----------------------------------------------------
Wherever “data” or “insights” are discussed (Home / For Professionals), keep it to ONE short paragraph:

“As DallasBeautyBook grows, anonymized insights will help you understand what DFW beauty clients are searching for—turning data into better decisions and new opportunities.”

Remove or replace any longer “data platform” paragraphs with this.


SECTION F — HOMEPAGE DENSITY & LIMITS
--------------------------------------
F1. LIMIT CARDS PER SECTION
---------------------------
For each of these homepage sections:
- Featured / latest businesses
- Community / forum preview
- Articles / guides preview

Use `.slice(0, 4)` for the displayed list in JSX and include a “View all →” link to the full page.

F2. SECTION ORDER (RECOMMENDED)
-------------------------------
Homepage sections should appear in this order (top to bottom):

1. Hero
2. “I’m here to:” CTA strip (A1)
3. “How it works” (shortened)  
4. “Start here: For locals / For pros” split section (A3)
5. Beauty Book highlight card
6. Explore / Directory preview
7. Community / Stories preview
8. For Professionals teaser or link

Do NOT remove sections; only reorder as necessary.
