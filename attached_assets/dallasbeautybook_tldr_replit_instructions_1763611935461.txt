=================================================================
GOAL

and emphasize monetization drivers: claimed listings, content submissions, 
and consumer-data insights.

SAFETY RULES (DO NOT BREAK)
---------------------------
1. Do NOT remove or rename existing pages, components, routes, or APIs.
2. Do NOT modify backend logic, DB schemas, or authentication flows.
3. Do NOT change Tailwind config, global.css, or design tokens.
4. Do NOT refactor or move component import paths.
5. New UI must follow existing mobile-first patterns.
